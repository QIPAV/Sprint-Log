Week one:

The Fixed Pitch Quadcopter has been assembled and had its first flight test. It was very unstable, but we
are working on improving stability. The communication with PC is getting better and we can now send
multiple data as one packet and decompose it on the Arduino. This will enable us to do the computing
off-board with minimal delay. We tested it and currently we are able to send data at least 10 times per
second. The arming sequence for the ESCs is also improved and we do not need to spin the motors with
a for-loop anymore.
We have built a test-rig that can help us test motor force, pwm-value at hover and min/max speed.
We also hope this can provide us with some data about the differences between Variable- and Fixed
Pitch.
