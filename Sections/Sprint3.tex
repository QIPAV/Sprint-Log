\section{Sprint 3}

% week one: This week we have established P-control in our test rig and established bluetooth communication. Design wise, there has been generated concepts for fixed pitch. Design plan of variable pitch quadcopter is under way. We also need to order the last components needed. We have also investigated several flight controller options. This includes planning our own setup as well as looking into the possibility of modifying ArduPilotMega or other existing platforms.

The past week, four variable pitch assemblies has been made with trex-500 tails. We hoped that we would
have more progress by now, but things have taken time. However we’ve almost finished the first version
of a basic flight controller. We have achieved communication with qualisys to the off-board computer.
We’ve almost finished the computation to find the angles roll, pitch and yaw. We’ve achieved communication
between the off-board and on-board flight controller. The on-board chip will receive these angles
and run the inner control loop for stabilization at these set-points. Our aim is to have this finished as
soon as possible, so we can start testing the code. Additionally, a document describing the mathematics
of fixed pitch quadcopters has been made, and variable pitch mathematics is underway.
We have completed 78% of the total tasks and we have had 16% scope change. We plan to improve
this for the next sprint.
