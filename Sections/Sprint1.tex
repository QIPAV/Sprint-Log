\section{Sprint 1}

%The project is still in an early stage, activities consists mostly of planning, research and documentation. Everything is on schedule for now. The first sprint will start January 17. The most critical activity for the upcoming sprint is the first presentation. During the next sprint, we also need to establish a clear understanding of how to work in parallel to accomplish the build and integration of the quadcopter system.


%Sprint 1 is complete and 90% percent of all planned tasks where executed. The remaining 10% of tasks are reevaluated, and if needed brought into sprint 2. In sprint 2, the main focus will be on creating the first prototype.

This sprint has mostly been centered around providing the right documentation to HSN, as well as preparing
the first presentation. The documents produced are: Organizational Document containing project
plan and organization, Backlog And Traceability Document, Preliminary Test Plan And Specification,
Qualisys Document, Feasibility Study. The critical activity for the next week is to make a design, order
parts and components to build the first quadcoopter, allowing flight controller experiments to be performed
in KIC.
Some technical tasks have been postponed due to documentation and presentation 1. We assume that
we will be able to catch up this workload in sprint 2. Time estimation and time-logging has been a challenge.
But we intend to to a better job at this for the second sprint. For the second sprint all activities
performed will be in the Sprint Backlog with traceability

All went well. After our first presentation we got a comment that it was not clear what our motivation for this project was. Why did we choose this project? Why does this project even exist? Important to say that we will take all the questions after the presentation is done. Karoline also said that we need to minimize or shorten our documentation. There is no need to repeat ourselves several times in the documentation. Maybe work on how to make one big file, instead of having many separate files. This will be reconsidered before the second presentation.
