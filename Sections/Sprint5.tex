\section{Sprint 5 summary}

At the beginning of sprint 5, we received the second batch of variable pitch mechanisms. These mechanisms was ordered from Rcecho.com, and looked different in the picture than the first batch. Our gamble was that the first batch was fake and that the new ones were of better quality.
The mechanisms were identical to the first batch and had just as poor quality, all shafts were bent and did not function properly. The shafts and metal seems to be of better quality than the first, but were still bent. It would be possible to change the inner shafts, but 1,46 mm hardened steel rods are hard to come by.

 The group has made improvements in the flight controller code. After running tests, we discovered that it works well until we moount the propellers on, which introduces vibrations. 
 
 
 The vibrations gets to high when we mount propellers on it, and the IMU gives wrong data. We must continue the sprint to research how to filter the data, and reduce the noise from the vibrations.
